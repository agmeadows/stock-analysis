# Stock Analysis by Year

## Project Overview

This project requires the collection of information for each stock ticker. Once this information is collected, a calculation is run to find the percentage of return. The data is then written to a sheet and formated based on the values. Green means the stock had a positive return and red means a negative return. The code should run efficiently given the large set of data.

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to quickly determine the return on investment for each ticker then display the information to a worksheet in an easily readable format.
